### What Happens When You Pair

1. **VS Code registers** with our secure cloud service
2. **You get a 6-digit code** that's unique to your VS Code instance  
3. **Mobile app uses code** to securely find your VS Code
4. **Direct connection established** - your code never goes through our servers
5. **AI chat and file access** work directly between your devices

### Security & Privacy

- **Your code stays private**: Only travels between your devices
- **Encrypted communication**: All data is encrypted end-to-end
- **No data storage**: We don't store your code or conversations
- **Temporary codes**: Pairing codes expire every 10 minutes
- **Local control**: You can stop the server anytime

### Network Magic

**The Cool Part**: Your devices don't need to be on the same WiFi!

- **Home WiFi + Mobile Data**: ✅ Works perfectly
- **Office network + Personal phone**: ✅ No problem
- **Coffee shop + Hotel WiFi**: ✅ Connects seamlessly
- **Different countries**: ✅ Works globally

This is possible because our cloud service acts as a secure "introduction service" - it helps your devices find each other, then gets out of the way.

> **Note**: Message broker endpoints require authentication token. Mobile apps and VS Code extension use these for cross-network message passing.

### Main Website Integration

The main website at `https://vscodercopilot.com.tr` provides:
- **Project Information**: Documentation, guides, and getting started resources
- **API Health Proxy**: `/health` endpoint proxies to the backend API for status checks
- **API Gateway**: `/api/*` endpoints proxy to the Discovery API backend
- **Resource Links**: Download links for mobile apps and development tools

The website serves as the primary entry point for users while the API subdomain handles all backend operations.

## Usage Examples

### Check System Health
```bash
# Main website health (proxies to API backend)
curl https://vscodercopilot.com.tr/health

# Direct API health check
curl https://api.vscodercopilot.com.tr/health
```

### Test Website API Proxy
```bash
# Test API endpoints through main website proxy
curl https://vscodercopilot.com.tr/api/v1/health

# Test authentication through website proxy
curl -X POST https://vscodercopilot.com.tr/api/v1/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_info": {"name": "test", "platform": "vscode", "version": "1.0.0"}}'
```

### Get Message Queue Status (for a pairing code)

## WebSocket-First Architecture

The VSCoder extension uses a **WebSocket-first approach** for real-time communication:

### Message Flow Architecture
```
Mobile App → Discovery API Message Broker → VS Code Extension
     ↓                    ↓                          ↓
Send Command → Queue Message by Pairing Code → WebSocket Notification
     ↑                    ↑                          ↓
Get Response ← Return Queued Result ← Process & Send Response
```

### Common Mobile Connection Issues

#### ❌ Getting 429 "Too Many Requests" Errors?

**This is expected behavior!** The mobile app should NOT connect directly to:
- `http://your-ip:8080/workspace` ❌  
- `http://your-ip:8080/files` ❌

**Correct connection flow:**
1. Use pairing code in mobile app ✅
2. App connects to discovery service ✅  
3. Discovery service provides VS Code connection details ✅
4. Secure connection established ✅

**Rate Limiting Details:**
- Discovery service: 60 requests/minute per IP (increased from 10)
- Mobile apps should use pairing codes for connection
- Direct API calls are limited for security

#### ❌ No Pairing Code Available?
- Run "Generate New Pairing Code"  
- Ensure VS Code server is running
- Check discovery service registration

#### ❌ Discovery Service Not Registered?
- Run "Test VSCoder Discovery Service"
- Check internet connection  
- Verify discovery service URL in settings
- Rate limits may cause temporary registration delays

#### ❌ Mobile App Can't Find VS Code?
- Ensure both devices have internet access
- Use the 6-digit pairing code (not direct IP connection)
- Check that VS Code extension is running
- Try generating a new pairing code

### Status Bar Indicators (Enhanced)

| Icon | Status | Meaning | Action |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `📱 123456 🔗` | ✅ Ready (API Connected) | Pairing code available, registered, API connected | Click for options |
| `📱 123456 📱` | ✅ Ready (Local Only) | Pairing code available, registered, local connection | Click for options |
| `📱 123456 ⚠️` | ⚠️ Warning | Code available, not registered with discovery service | Click to troubleshoot |
| `📱 VSCoder ❌` | ❌ Error | No pairing code available | Click to troubleshoot |
| `📱 VSCoder (Stopped)` | 🔌 Offline | Server not running | Click to start |

### Discovery Service vs VS Code Server

**Important:** Mobile apps should distinguish between these services:

**Discovery Service** (https://api.vscodercopilot.com.tr):
- 🔍 Device registration and discovery
- 🔐 Pairing code validation  
- 🛡️ Rate limiting for security (60 req/min)
- 🌐 Cross-network device finding

**VS Code Server** (Discovered via pairing):
- 📁 Actual workspace and file access
- 🤖 Copilot integration
- 🔄 Real-time collaboration  
- ✏️ Code editing capabilities

### API Updates for Mobile Apps

The VS Code server now provides helpful error messages when mobile apps connect to wrong endpoints:

```json
// GET /workspace response (wrong endpoint)
{
  "error": "This is a VS Code server, not the discovery service",
  "message": "Use the discovery service with your pairing code",
  "guidance": {
    "step1": "Use the VSCoder mobile app pairing feature",
    "step2": "Enter your 6-digit pairing code", 
    "step3": "App will auto-discover this VS Code instance"
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting Best Practices

1. **Mobile Apps**: Always use pairing codes for initial connection
2. **Direct Connections**: Only after successful pairing
3. **Error Handling**: Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors
4. **User Guidance**: Show helpful messages for rate limit errors

**Quick fix**:
1. **Use Refresh Button**: Tap the refresh button in the mobile app after navigation
2. **Automatic Solution**: The refresh button now mimics page refresh behavior
3. **Force Reconnect**: Mobile app uses `forceReconnect()` to reset WebSocket state completely
4. **Works Like Magic**: Should now work exactly like manual page refresh

**Technical Details**: The `forceReconnect()` method clears all WebSocket state, listeners, and message tracking, then re-establishes connection from scratch - exactly like a page refresh.

#### ⏰ "Pairing Code Expired"

**What you see**: Code doesn't work in mobile app
**Why**: Codes expire every 10 minutes for security
**Quick fix**: Run `VSCoder: Generate New Pairing Code`

**Pairing Code Problems**

- ### Mobile App Connection Issues

**Use the Mobile Troubleshooter**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "VSCoder: Troubleshoot Mobile App Connection"

#### ❌ Getting 429 "Too Many Requests" Errors?

**This is expected behavior!** Mobile apps should NOT connect directly to:
- `http://your-ip:8080/workspace` ❌  
- `http://your-ip:8080/files` ❌

**Correct connection flow:**
1. Use pairing code in VSCoder mobile app ✅
2. App connects to discovery service at \`api.vscodercopilot.com.tr\` ✅  
3. Discovery service provides VS Code connection details ✅
4. Secure tunneled connection established ✅

**Rate limiting details:**
- Discovery service: 60 requests/minute per IP
- VS Code server: Direct connections only after pairing
- Direct API calls without pairing are blocked for security

**Discovery API Endpoints Used by Mobile Apps:**
- `POST /api/v1/messages/send` - Send messages through broker
- `GET /api/v1/messages/:pairingCode/:receiver` - Get messages for device (vscode/mobile)
- `DELETE /api/v1/messages/:pairingCode/:receiver` - Clear messages for device 
- `GET /api/v1/messages/:pairingCode/status` - Get message queue status
- WebSocket `/api/v1/messages/ws` - Real-time communication

#### ❌ Mobile App Can't Find VS Code?

**Step-by-step diagnosis:**
1. **Check Extension Status**: Ensure VS Code server is running
2. **Verify Registration**: Extension should be registered with discovery service
3. **Get Fresh Code**: Generate new pairing code if current one expired
4. **Test Connectivity**: Both devices need internet access (not same network)
5. **Check Firewall**: Ensure HTTPS connections are allowed

**Common mistakes:**
- Trying to connect to local IP instead of using pairing code
- Using expired pairing codes (>10 minutes old)
- Extension not registered with discovery service
- Network blocking HTTPS connections

#### ❌ Discovery Service Not Responding?

**Troubleshooting steps:**

2. **Check Configuration**: Verify `vscoder.api.url` setting
3. **Network Diagnostics**: Test internet connectivity and DNS resolution
4. **Firewall Check**: Ensure HTTPS outbound connections allowed
5. **Rate Limits**: Wait if receiving 429 errors (temporary)

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**File Access Denied**
- **Cause**: Attempting to access files outside workspace
- **Solution**: Ensure all file paths are within current workspace boundaries
- **Security**: This is intentional - extension only accesses workspace files

**Model Switching Issues**
- **Cause**: VS Code API limitations for programmatic model switching
- **Workaround**: Model switching may open UI picker instead of direct switch
- **Expected**: This is current VS Code behavior, not an extension bug

**Performance Issues**
- **Memory**: Extension monitors Copilot continuously - this is normal
- **CPU**: Background monitoring is lightweight and optimized
- **Network**: WebSocket connections maintained for real-time updates

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to pay for anything?**
A: The VS Code extension is completely free! The mobile app offers a 1-day free trial, then requires a premium subscription (Monthly $9.99 or Annual $99.99) for unlimited AI features.

**Q: Does this work with my existing GitHub Copilot subscription?**
A: Yes! VSCoder uses your existing GitHub Copilot subscription. You just need Copilot installed and authenticated in VS Code.

**Q: Is my code safe and private?**
A: Absolutely. Your code travels directly between your devices through encrypted connections. We don't store or see your code - our service just helps your devices find each other.

**Q: What if I don't have the same WiFi network?**
A: That's the magic! VSCoder works across different networks. Your phone can be on mobile data while your computer is on office WiFi - no problem.

### Setup Questions

**Q: Why do I need a 6-digit code?**
A: The code is like a temporary password that helps your mobile app securely find your VS Code instance. Codes expire every 10 minutes for security.

**Q: Can I use this with multiple projects?**
A: Yes! The mobile app can save multiple workspace profiles, and you can quickly switch between different VS Code instances.

**Q: Do I need to configure firewall or network settings?**
A: Nope! VSCoder uses standard HTTPS connections that work through most networks and firewalls automatically.

### Usage Questions

**Q: Can multiple people connect to the same VS Code?**
A: Each pairing code works for one mobile device at a time. If you want team collaboration, each team member should use their own VS Code + mobile app.

**Q: What happens if my internet connection is spotty?**
A: VSCoder automatically reconnects when your connection comes back. Your conversations and progress are preserved.

**Q: Can I use this without GitHub Copilot?**
A: The mobile app can browse and edit files without Copilot, but you'll need an active Copilot subscription for AI features.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which AI models does this support?**
A: All models available through your GitHub Copilot subscription - GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and any future models GitHub adds.

**Q: Does this slow down VS Code?**
A: No, the extension runs efficiently in the background and doesn't impact VS Code performance.

**Q: Can I turn off the mobile connection?**
A: Yes! Use `VSCoder: Stop VSCoder Server` to disable mobile connectivity anytime.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: My pairing code doesn't work - what's wrong?**
A: Codes expire every 10 minutes for security. Generate a fresh one with `VSCoder: Generate New Pairing Code`.

**Q: The mobile app says "connection failed" - help!**
A: Run `VSCoder: Run VSCoder Diagnostics` in VS Code for instant troubleshooting. Most issues are fixed automatically.

**Q: Can I use this behind a corporate firewall?**
A: VSCoder uses standard HTTPS connections that work through most corporate networks. If you have issues, ask your IT team to allow connections to `*.vscodercopilot.com.tr`.
